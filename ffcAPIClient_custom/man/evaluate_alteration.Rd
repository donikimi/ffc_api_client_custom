\title{Generate FFC Results and Plots for Timeseries Data}
\usage{
evaluate_alteration(
  timeseries_df,
  token,
  comid,
  longitude,
  latitude,
  plot_output_folder,
  plot_results,
  date_format_string,
  return_processor
)
}
\arguments{
\item{timeseries_df}{A timeseries dataframe that includes fields named "flow" and "date" for each record. Date should either
be in MM/DD/YYYY format, or parameter \code{date_format_string} must be specified. The data frame may include other fields,
which will be automatically dropped when sent to the FFC.}

\item{token}{The token used to access the online FFC - see the Github repository's README under Setup for how to get this.}

\item{comid}{The stream segment COMID where the gage is located. You may also have the package look this information up automatically
based on longitude and latitude, but we discovered that our method for looking gage COMIDs up is error prone,
and there is no authoritative dataset that relates gages to COMIDs correctly. It will be most accurate if you
provide the comid yourself by looking it up (don't use nhdPlusTools with the latitude and longitude
that's what we did that was error prone).}

\item{longitude}{the longitude of the location the flow data were collected at.}

\item{latitude}{the latitude of the location the flow data were collected at. If both longitude and latitude are defined, then
and parameter comid is missing, then the COMID will be looked up. See notes on parameter comid for cautions and limitations.}

\item{plot_output_folder}{Optional - when not provided, plots are displayed interactively only. When provided, they are
displayed interactively and saved as files named by the functional flow componenent into the provided folder}

\item{plot_results}{boolean, default \code{TRUE} - when \code{TRUE}, results are plotted to the screen and any folder provided. When
FALSE, does no plotting.}

\item{date_format_string}{character. Default "%m/%d/%Y". What date format string should be used in interpreting the dates in the date field?}
}
\description{
Processes timeseries data using the functional flows calculator and returns results for metric percentiles, annual metric values,
predicted metric values, flow alteration, and drh data.

\details{
See the documentation for \code{evaluate_gage_alteration} for complete details on the processing and what is returned.
