#' Assess hydrologic alteration by flow metric
#'
#' Returns a data frame with an alteration status assessment for every flow metric.
#'
#' Generates an alteration status assessment for every flow metric based on the rules developed under CEFF for flow
#' alteration. This function pairs well with the boxplots for visualizing alteration, but only this function assesses
#' the data under the rules. Returns a data frame with columns "metric" , "status_code",
#' "status", "alteration_type", "median_in_iqr", and "comid".
#'
#' The \code{comid} will be the same for all rows, and will match what you provide
#' as an input, but allows for merging of these results into larger tables.
#'
#' \code{status_code} will be -1 (likely altered), 0 (indeterminate), 1 (likely unaltered), or NA (insufficient data to determine).
#' \code{status} will be a text description of the status code (-1=likely_altered, 0=indeterminate, 1=likely_unaltered, NA=Not_enough_data).
#' \code{alteration_type} will tell you the direction of potential alteration for likely altered and indeterminate metrics - the direction
#' of alteration is determined by comparing the median value to the 25th and 7th percentiles of the predicted metrics. It will
#' provide "low" or "high" values for most metrics and "early" or "late" values for timing metrics. For likely_unaltered metrics,
#' it will provide "none_found" and for metrics with insufficient data, it will provide "undeterminable.". Also includes a boolean field
#' \code{median_in_iqr} indicating whether the median is in the interquartile range.
#'
#'
#' @param percentiles dataframe of calculated FFC results percentiles, including the metric column and columns for p10,p25,p50,p75, and p90
#' @param predictions dataframe of predicted flow metrics, as returned from \code{get_predicted_flow_metrics}.
#' @param ffc_values dataframe of the raw results from the online FFC, as returned by \code{evaluate_gage_alteration} or \code{get_results_as_df}
#' @param comid integer comid of the stream segment the previous parameters are for
#' @param annual boolean indicating whether to run a year over year analysis. If \code{TRUE}, then the parameter \code{percentiles}
#'               changes and should be a data frame with only two columns - the first is still \code{metric}, but the second is just
#'               \code{value} representing the current year's value for the metric. \code{predictions} should then still have fields
#'               for the \code{metric}, \code{p25}, and \code{p75}, where \code{p25} and \code{p75} represent the lower and upper
#'               bounds for comparison, regardless of if they're calculated percentiles, or another set of bounds. When run in an
#'               annual mode, it assesses alteration similarly to the description above, and with the same result structure, but
#'               provides likely_unaltered results when \code{value} is within the \code{p25} and \code{p75} values, and provides
#'               likely_altered otherwise without additional checks described in the CEFF guidance document, appendix F.
